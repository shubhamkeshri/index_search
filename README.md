# Clone

- Select "Projects from Git" and click Next >
- Click "Clone..." to create a local copy of the remote repository. This copy will include the full project history
- Copy & Paste the GitHub URI in the Location field. 
- If you want to use SSH make sure you provided GitHub with your public key to allow write-access.
- If in doubt use the HTTPS URI and authenticate yourself with your GitHub credentials.
- The read-only URI of the repository is https://github.com/shubhamkeshri/index_search.git.
- Select the master branch (or arbitrary branches you like)
- Now choose a location where the local repository is stored: Create <workspace>/repos/Index_Search and click "Finish".
- Create the project
- Select our newly cloned repository and click Next
- Select "Import Existing Projects" and depending on your Eclipse version enable automatic sharing.
