Using Git & Eclipse

To clone the project from within Eclipse, 
you may need to install EGit first
(Eclipse: Help → Marketplace → Search for egit or get it from http://www.eclipse.org/egit/).

Clone
In the Package Explorer to the left use right-click and choose Import...
Select "Projects from Git" and click Next >
Click "Clone..." to create a local copy of the remote repository. This copy will include the full project history
Copy & Paste the GitHub URI in the Location field. 
If you want to use SSH make sure you provided GitHub with your public key to allow write-access.
If in doubt use the HTTPS URI and authenticate yourself with your GitHub credentials.
The read-only URI of the repository is https://github.com/shubhamkeshri/index_search.git.
Select the master branch (or arbitrary branches you like)
Now choose a location where the local repository is stored: Create <workspace>/repos/Index_Search and click "Finish".
Create the project
Select our newly cloned repository and click Next
Select "Import Existing Projects" and depending on your Eclipse version enable automatic sharing.
More recent versions will not offer this feature as sharing is enabled by default.
Click next to select the Project to import
Check "Index_Search" to checkout and click finish
You are now ready to contribute.
